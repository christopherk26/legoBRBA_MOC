Made using lego Stud.io LEGO CAD technology, as well as some renders in blender. 
Lego stud.io - made and maintained by bricklink, which is now an official LEGO compnay. (https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page)

This custom set was inspired by a youtuber who made the design for the RV. I added more to the interior and made instructions and a parts list.

If you are interested in Breaking bad minifigures, while there are LEGO customs, LEGO "purists" (meaning a Lego fan who primarily or exclusively uses genuine, unaltered Lego parts in their creations) will appreciate this video that shows many Breaking Bad characters remade very accurately using ONLY genuine LEGO bricks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oTcvCwi_0g&t=671s
